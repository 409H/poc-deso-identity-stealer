    <h3>Some really good trusted extension</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>That was bought by a malicious actor?</li>
      <li>Build process was compromised?</li>
      <li>Deployment process compromised?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We can use the extension with <strong>activeTab</strong>, <strong>storage</strong> permissions to force open the deso 
      identity app, read the localStorage, send it back to our extension service worker, decrypt it, and exfil it to 
      some remote server.
